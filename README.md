## Project
#### Instruction:
For our project, we were to construct a database and query it sufficiently so that we could demonstrate our knowledge of MySQL. We chose to create a database for a tennis club.

#### Client:
ChatGPT 4 was the client/owner of the tennis club for whom we built our database. To see our prompt and the response, please visit this link: https://chat.openai.com/share/12733a36-8c47-4f03-92ab-ea641e4d3f43.

#### Overview:
After consulting our client, we spent some time brainstorming and created an overview of the database:
